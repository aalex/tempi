To do in Tempi
==============

 * fix packaging for liboscpack
 * Update the tempi demo to optionally (boost::options) use a Wacom pen
 * Create the tempi-plugins-base library
 * Create a timeline viewing actor.
 * Enclose signals as private data member. Provide accessors to it, or allow to add callbacks to it.
 * Create Node::onSchedulerTick()
 * Create a Graph class, with a tick() method, which calls each node's onSchedulerTick().
 * Create a OscReceiver, using a ConcurrentQueue<boost::tuple<std::string, Message> > (and a boost::signals2::signal?)
 * Create a OscSourceNode
 * Many sender/receiver with the same host+port should share the same OSC sender. Use a map of tuple<ip,port> to shared_ptr<OscSender>.
