To do in Tempi
==============

Soon
-----
 * Create a NodeLibrary class with a load() static template method
 * Prevent from recursion by throwing a RecursionException upon output triggered twice. No?
 * Create the tempi-plugins-base library
 * Enclose signals as private data member. Provide accessors to it, or allow to add callbacks to it.
 * Fix test for MetroNode
 * move CounterNode to base.

Later
-----
 * Many sender/receiver with the same host+port should share the same OSC sender. Use a map of tuple<ip,port> to shared_ptr<OscSender>.
 * Get done with tempi/samplernode.cpp
 * Get done with tempi/tempi-signal.h
 * Create MIDI sink and sources nodes
 * Create a timeline viewing Clutter actor.
