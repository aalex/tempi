To do in Tempi
==============

To do for 0.2
-------------
 * Implement Scehduler::deleteGraph
 * Fix test for MetroNode
 * Get done with tempi/samplernode.cpp
 * Get done with tempi/tempi-signal.h
 * Get done with [table.*]
 * Get done with [sampler.*]
 * Get done with [mapping.*]
 * Have a complete scheduler in a thread.
 * Get done with nodes' arguments.
 * Provide complete introspection for nodes' attributes.
 * Provide complete introspection for nodes' methods.
 * Tracks and state machines must be multithread-safe
 * Each scheduler should access some tracks
 * Each scheduler should access some state machines
 * Save graph to XML
 * Load graph from XML

To do for 0.4
-------------
 * Create libraries of nodes (tempi-plugins-base)
 * Enclose signals as private data member. Provide accessors to it, or allow to add callbacks to it.
 * Feature: Many sender/receiver with the same host+port should share the same OSC sender. Use a map of tuple<ip,port> to shared_ptr<OscSender>.
 * Bugfix: Prevent from recursion by throwing a RecursionException upon output triggered twice. No?
 * Implement [route], [trigger], [passiftypematches], [spigot], [converttype]
 * Implement [math.>], [math.<], [math.==], [math.-], [math.+], [math.*], [math./], [math.clip], [sqrt], [rsqrt]
 * Implement [mtof], [ftom], [dbtorms], [rmstodb], [dbtopow], [powtodb], [exp], [log], [abs]
 * Implement [wrap] ?
 * Implement [delay]
 * Implement [textfile]
 * Implement [pdsend], [pdreceive]
 * Support loading extensions and finding files from a list of paths
 * Implement [regex]
 * Improve FilterNode to explode arrays and make sure they are doubles, not floats.
 * All nodes should have an enabled attribute
 * Feature: allow to configure externals with an XML config file. (system-wide, then user-specific)

Later
-----
 * Create a timeline Clutter actor.
 * Create a graph editor Clutter actor.
