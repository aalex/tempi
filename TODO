To do in Tempi
==============

Soon
-----
 * Create a timeline viewing actor.
 * create a node type registrator and factory. (NodeFactory::create(string type))
 * Create the tempi-plugins-base library
 * Enclose signals as private data member. Provide accessors to it, or allow to add callbacks to it.
 * Create Node::onSchedulerTick()
 * Create a Graph class, with a tick() method, which calls each node's onSchedulerTick(). Use boost::adjacency_list
 * Create a OscSourceNode

Later
-----
 * Many sender/receiver with the same host+port should share the same OSC sender. Use a map of tuple<ip,port> to shared_ptr<OscSender>.
 * Get done with tempi/samplernode.cpp
 * Get done with tempi/graph.cpp
 * Get done with tempi/noderegistry.h
 * Get done with tempi/tempi-signal.h
 * Create MIDI sink and sources nodes
