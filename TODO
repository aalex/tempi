To do in Tempi
==============

To do for 0.1.6
---------------
 * Add Node::init, onInit, isInitiated
 * Move network and MIDI initialization in each Node::onInit implementation.
 * sampler::Player: Fix weird timing issues with events at beginning of regions.
 * add ReceiverNode

To do for 0.2
-------------
 * Bugfix: Message.*(...): avoid segfault if length does not match
 * Bugfix: Message.*(...): avoid segfault if types do not match
 * Implement Message.prepend*()
 * Implement [route] and [prepend]
 * Rename Filter to FilterNode.
 * FilterNode.filter should return a const&
 * Node.addOutlet: document outlets with i18n
 * Node.addInlet: document inlets with i18n
 * Node.addProperty: document properties with i18n
 * Write Node.addMethod, and document them with i18n (?)
 * Decide on the messages that Scheduler sends and receives.
 * Split SamplerNode into ReaderNode and WriterNode.
 * Have a complete scheduler in a thread.
 * Get done with [midi.*] (make sure it works)
 * Get done with [sampler.*]
 * Get done with nodes' arguments.
 * Implement [spigot]
 * Implement Scheduler::deleteGraph
 * Fix test for MetroNode
 * Get done with tempi/tempi-signal.h (or delete it)
 * [mapping.*] should be provided a typetag argument. (and support fdi)
 * Create a matrix atom type.
 * Get done with [mapping.*]
 * Provide complete introspection for nodes' attributes.
 * Provide complete introspection for nodes' methods.
 * Tracks and state machines must be multithread-safe
 * Each scheduler should access some tracks
 * Each scheduler should access some state machines
 * Implement Score, Track, Region, Trajectory (which have a ReadType). Score has Markers.
 * Save graphs to XML
 * Load graphs from XML
 * Save scores to XML
 * Load scores from XML
 * Regions have speed. 

To do for 0.4
-------------
 * Regions have mapping modifiers. (range, clip, etc.)
 * Regions have follow actions. (nothing, stop, play again, previous, next, first, last, any, other)
 * Get done with [table.*]
 * Create libraries of nodes (tempi-plugins-base)
 * Enclose signals as private data member. Provide accessors to it, or allow to add callbacks to it.
 * Implement [trigger], [passiftypematches], [converttype]
 * Implement [math.>], [math.<], [math.==], [math.-], [math.+], [math.*], [math./], [math.clip], [sqrt], [rsqrt]
 * Implement [delay]
 * Improve FilterNode to explode arrays and make sure they are doubles, not floats.
 * Feature: allow to configure externals with an XML config file. (system-wide, then user-specific)
 * Application: Write a basic trajectories editor, for 3D coordinates with 3D and 2D views. (like Hole-edit)
 * Application: Write a basic node editor.
 * Implement [osc.push] and [osc.pop]

To do for 0.6
-------------
 * Implement [wrap] ?
 * Implement [rtpsend], [rtpreceive]
 * Implement [spatosc]
 * Implement [freenect.pointscloud]
 * Implement [textfile]
 * Implement [pdsend], [pdreceive]
 * Implement [mtof], [ftom], [dbtorms], [rmstodb], [dbtopow], [powtodb], [exp], [log], [abs]
 * Support loading extensions and finding files from a list of paths
 * Implement [regex]
 * All nodes should have an enabled attribute
 * All nodes should have a verbose attribute
 * Decide on how many inlet/outlet a Node minimally has.
 * Implement Node::error, which triggers a signal that the Graph catches.
 * Feature: Many OSC sender/receiver with the same host+port should share the same OSC sender. Use a map of tuple<ip,port> to shared_ptr<OscSender>.
 * Bugfix: Prevent from recursion by throwing a RecursionException upon output triggered twice. No?

Later
-----
 * Create a timeline Clutter actor.
 * Create a graph editor Clutter actor.
